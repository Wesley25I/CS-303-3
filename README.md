# CS-303-3

This project demonstrates the usage of various data structures, including a Queue and a Linked List with functions for sorting and searching.

# Features:
1. Queue: Implements a queue using a linked list with functions like `push()`, `pop()`, `move_to_rear()`, and `front()`.
2. LinkedList: Implements a singly linked list with insertion sort and basic operations like `insert()` and `display()`.
3. Recursive Search: Searches for the last occurrence of a target value in a vector using recursion.

# How to Run the Code

1. Clone or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++).
